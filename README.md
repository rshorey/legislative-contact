# legislative-contact

code to pull just contact information for all state legislators from Sunlight Foundation's Open States API.

Notes:
1) the csv here is not up to date, so you should re-run this code locally if you want the current status of the API
2) you will need your own [Sunlight API key](https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/)
